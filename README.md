This project mimics the Tinder-like profile swiping effect on the web, offering a sleek and interactive way to browse user profiles. It features smooth card transition animations using GSAP, a modern UI with Tailwind CSS, and dynamic profile updates powered by JavaScript. Users can view profile details, including name, age, location, and interests, and interact using accept/reject buttons. The seamless animations ensure an engaging experience, making it feel fluid and intuitive, similar to the Tinder app's swiping mechanism.
